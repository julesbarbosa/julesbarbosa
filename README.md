# Professional Experience
### Research Scientist
New York University (NYU) | New York, USA
Feb 2023 - Present

Led research in the Disrupting Operations of Illicit Supply Networks (D-ISN) project, collaborating with interdisciplinary research groups.
Developed computational infrastructure, data collection pipelines, and web crawlers for comprehensive data analysis and tracking online advertisements.
Deployed storage systems (Minio, Elasticsearch) in production using Kubernetes.
Created a web-based data annotation tool for domain experts to generate training data for wildlife trading analysis.
Fine-tuned deep learning models (BERT) and LLMs (Llama 2) using PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers to improve classification performance.
Developed a novel active learning sampling approach using LLM-generated pseudo-labels for unbalanced datasets, minimizing labeling costs.
Trained a multi-modal model to achieve 95% accuracy in classifying illegal wildlife advertisements.
